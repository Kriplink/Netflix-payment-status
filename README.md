# Netflix-payment-status
I'm making my first C++ project, where I want to see the people using my Netflix account, and the status, whether they paid that months "fee".

I want to have buttons, each representing a person, and their status, whether they paid that month or not. After clicking the button, I want the button going from red(not paid) to green(paid), the date and time, the button was pressed to be saved in a list, of the last 12 months. 

It's a simple program, but because it's my first C++ project, it's taken me some time to think it up.
